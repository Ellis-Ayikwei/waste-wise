# ByteDev

ByteDev is a Flutter application designed to provide a seamless user experience with state management using Redux. This project serves as a foundation for building scalable and maintainable mobile applications.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that implements state management principles. It follows best practices for organizing code and managing application state effectively.

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- An IDE such as Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, or IntelliJ IDEA

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bytedev.git
   cd bytedev
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Features

- **State Management**: Utilizes Redux for managing application state.
- **Onboarding Screen**: A full-screen onboarding experience to guide users through the app's features.
- **Responsive Design**: Supports various screen sizes and orientations.

## Assets

The `assets` directory contains images, fonts, and other files included with the application. The `assets/images` directory houses resolution-aware images for optimal display on different devices.

## Localization

This project supports localization through ARB files located in the `lib/src/localization` directory. To add support for additional languages, refer to the tutorial on [Internationalizing Flutter apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization).
